### Week 1
---
- During the first tutorial I formed a team with Summer, Ishmam, Jeffrey and Dominic. 
- It was decided our team name was ‘JAIDS’ and the project we would undertake was the     Recipe Recommendation System, with Jeffrey being our designated scrum master. 
- The backend team consisted of Summer, Ishmam, and Jeffrey; with Austina and Dominic being on the frontend team. 
- We established channels of communication by creating a Messenger group chat. 
- The proposal document was created, and we set up JIRA.

### Week 2
---
- The team started working on the proposal. In particular, we crafted user stories as a team and finalised the requirements and novelty features of our project. This was done after conducting research on existing websites that feature a recipe recommendation system. 
- We assigned sections of the proposal to each team member.
- The plan is to reconvene as a team during Week 3 to discuss our progress.
- My assigned portion was the interface and flow diagrams (storyboard).
- I started sketching and brainstorming some designs on paper before I plan on switching to Figma to create a low fidelity prototype of the website.

### Week 3
---
- A new novelty feature was brainstormed during the tutorial (Recipe Assistant).
- I worked on and completed the interfaces for our website on Figma.
- In addition, I made a flowchart to visualise all possible user flows.
- Screenshots of the interfaces and flowchart were added to the proposal document, with written explanations and detailed labelling included.
- The team finished and submitted the proposal document and submitted.

### Week 4

- The team began writing code.
- Dominic and I created a UML diagram so that both the backend and frontend team would have a foundation to work from. 
- The diagram included information such as the classes, functions and inputs/outputs required.
